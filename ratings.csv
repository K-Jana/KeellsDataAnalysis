As a regular customer who appreciates the usual standards at Keells, I was quite disappointed with the experience at this branch.

When I approached the bakery section, there was no staff present at the counter, and since self-service seemed available, I took a box and started selecting a few pastries. Suddenly, a male staff member appeared, took the box from my hand without any explanation or courteous communication. In a very dull tone, he asked, ‚ÄúWhat do you want?‚Äù, which felt dismissive and unwelcoming.

Due to this impolite interaction, I decided not to proceed with my purchase. I also noticed that other staff members in the area were not friendly or attentive, which made the environment feel cold and uninviting ‚Äî something I do not expect from Keells.

The only staff member who showed professionalism and warmth was the security officer at the entrance. He greeted customers pleasantly and was the only one who reflected the kind of customer service Keells is known for.

I hope the management will look into the staff training and customer service standards at this outlet. Keells usually maintains a high reputation for service quality, but this experience did not meet that standard."

Great Shopping Experience at Keells ‚Äì Anuradhapura

Keells Supermarket in Anuradhapura offers a clean, well-organized shopping environment with a wide selection of fresh produce, groceries, and household essentials. The quality of items is consistently good, and everything is neatly arranged for easy access.

The staff is friendly and helpful, ready to assist with a smile. Billing is not quick and efficient.   It's definitely one of the best supermarkets in the area for a comfortable and reliable shopping experience.

Shopping is not always just about buying products, but also about enjoying a bit of relaxation, and Keells has always been a place that provides that for me.

Ive been a loyal customer for over four years and overall, my experience with Keells has been very good. However, Ive noticed that the customer service at Anuradhapura outlet‚Äôs cashier could improve‚Ä¶! On a few occasions (around four times!), I felt that the service, especially from one cashier named Tharindu ‚Äî was not very welcoming or polite. His attitudes clearly spoiled my shopping experience there.

Im sharing this feedback not to complain, but in the hope that it helps the team to improve. With a little guidance and training, I believe the staff can offer the same warm and friendly service that Keells is known for."

Time: Around 11-12

This incident occurred this morning. My fianc√©e and I went shopping, and before moving to another shopping spot, we wanted to have a snack. We decided to stop at the Keells Anuradhapura outlet. I asked my fianc√©e to go inside and get the snacks while I waited outside. Due to the unbearable heat, I parked my motorcycle in the shade near the car park.

Suddenly, a car approached aggressively, and the driver demanded that I move my bike. I explained that I was staying there because of the heat. However, this rude individual, who identified himself as the customer care officer of Keells and claimed to oversee all outlets, pointed his finger at me and threatened to have me move my bike. I was extremely disappointed by his behavior. A security guard also approached and asked me to move my bike.

This so-called customer care officer, named Krishan Fakeel or something similar, pushed me and hit me. I did not retaliate, but I shouted at him. When my fianc√©e returned, I informed her of the incident. She immediately contacted the manager of the Anuradhapura branch. To be honest, the rest of the staff was very supportive. My fianc√©e waited to speak directly with that individual, and they had a face-to-face conversation outside. He told us that if we wanted an apology, we could have it, but his behavior was truly terrible.

I was about to take immediate action, but I have had good experiences with Keells in the past, and I hope the company will take swift action regarding this matter. It is crucial to address the behavior of such individuals, as they put the organization‚Äôs dignity and reputation at risk. If this is how customer care is managed, it raises serious concerns for John Keells. My fianc√©e has filed a complaint with the head office of Keells, and I hope you will consider this matter as soon as possible.

Every Sunday after we come home we recheck the bill with the products, and several times we had to go back to Keells due to errors in billing. Either the cashier has billed the same item twice, or billed a different price to the item.

Due to these concerns, we stopped going to the Werahera Keells and went to the Rattanapitiya branch which was a seamless experience.

After several months we decided to go to the Werahera branch today and once we came home and rechecked the bill, we realized that the million rush numbers were not included in the bill. We split today‚Äôs bill into two and purchased and the numbers were not included in both these bills. When we called the branch, the delivery person answered and simply said that it is a system issue. We understand that system issues can happen however, this means that since morning the cashier has not checked if the bills have been printed properly since at the time we checked out at the cashier it was already 12pm (half the day gone). Especially when there is a raffle ongoing it‚Äôs a must to check if the bill is printed properly as per my understanding.

Once we called back after few hours to get a resolution the same person spoke and simply said we have raised it with IT, which means there is no real favor for us in this situation.

We live near the Boralesgamuwa junction and have several other supermarkets that is closer to us than Keells, however we still prefer going to Keells due to the standard and quality of your products and services. However, when faced with such situations it is very disappointing"

When I purchased the goods, it was noted they haven't offered the discount. So I talk to them. At the counter I redeemed my star points as well. As per the manager, after redeeming star points, credit card discount may not be applicable. But the manager lady is a nice person and she apologized to me regarding not being informed of this earlier by her team. After that she solved my issue and offered the discount at a new bill.

I said no problem as I can do my shopping till then. I showed up at the counter after 30 minutes as there was no sign of my order or any other order being prepared and after standing there for another 10 minutes (after waiting for the initial 30 minutes), the same server came and said it will take another 30 minutes (basically 1 hour to prepare a chicken bucket which they were running a promo forüôÑ). It was quite apparent that they didn't want to take the orders because no one else was getting anything either. We left feeling disgusted for wasting our time because they should have been prepared if they were running a promo. Horrible service by the Keells Embuldeniya bakery staff.

They have a huge variety of products, local and international. I've included photos for a sense of what they sell. The products are clean and always within the expiry dates that I've seen so far. And they keep well since it's always in a cool AC environment.

Their produce pricing is actually comparable and sometimes cheaper than mom & pops shops or markets but it changes daily, as with other produce stores. The price of snacks and other dry goods with prices already printed on the packaging by the manufacturer seems the same across all shops. One consistent thing I've noticed regarding the pricing is that their organic Batavia lettuce (1500 per kg) has not changed in the last months even after more than 5 price hikes in the last months, and is cheaper than anywhere else I've seen, compared with the lesser valued, non organic, regular lettuce (2000 or more per kg). Their keells products also tend to be cheaper so snag those instead of a competitor's if you see any! But their grains, legumes and bakery items seem quite expensive, sometimes more than double the price of RTS or local grocery stores or bakeries.

The loyalty card there is worthwhile but cost 200 SLR (which I was not informed). I managed to accumulate about 100 SLR for redemption at the end of my three month stay with a once a week or less visit. And have received a handful of discounts on certain items because of the card. I always buy dry goods (but not grains or legumes), snacks, Batavia lettuce, limes, specialty greens (celery, kale, cilantro) and fruit (the pears and apples on discount) there, but sometimes also regular veggies that may be on discount (cucumbers, dill, mukunuwena). Their eggs are also top notch quality, brown shells with delicious creamy yolks, compared to cheaper white shelled ones I've gotten at RTS and Cargills.

The staff speaks English, and there's usually someone mopping the floors when I visit. Their produce comes in daily around 9am. And by the afternoon the greens are usually sparse. The Batavia lettuce comes once a week, usually Wed or Thurs. Otherwise they also have regular lettuce in the mornings.

Give them a visit if you're curious or in need of produce, dry goods, household goods or medicines."

It's not any problem with the products. Staff is the problem. First the staff look like they are scared of people. They don't even smile with us or respond to any question we ask. They act like we are buying things using their money. Even the security is not friendly. They all act like we have done something bad for them. Please hire staff that are friendly. Keells commercials are saying that the staff is friendly and nice but in reality they look at us like they have seen some monsters. Please make sure that the staff is friendly and pleasant.

Firstly, the security personnel at the entrance did not greet customers with a smile and appeared visibly upset. Inside the store, the layout was quite messy and navigating through the aisles with a cart was difficult due to limited space.

The most unpleasant part of the visit was at the donuts section, where two customer service staff members behaved very unprofessionally. They were laughing among themselves and completely ignored our simple inquiry. They  continued to laugh while looking directly at us, which felt very disrespectful.

This review is long, but please read because it has important information you need to know.

I was scrolling through Facebook when I got to know about Meathouse (An online store by Keells Food Products PLC to sell their meat products). At the time, Meathouse was offering attractive salary week discounts. I thought it was the perfect opportunity to try it out to make burgers at home since McDonald‚Äôs is closed.

I ordered chicken slices, meatballs, French fries, pasta and Chinese rolls. Unfortunately, the Frankie skinless and cheese sausages (Bundle offer with a free Rubik‚Äôs cube) was sold out. Despite this, I placed my order.

A few hours later, the Frankie sausages bundle was back in stock so I had to place another order on the same day (26/03/2024) as there was no feature to edit the previous order. I informed this to the management in advance so that I am not charged double the delivery fee.

Meathouse said I will receive the order within 72 hours. As promised, it was delivered to me on 28/03/2024, which is a good delivery speed. However, they charged double the delivery fee. The products were tightly packaged so I couldn‚Äôt check it on the spot.
Later, at home, I checked the expiry dates. The Chinese rolls, pasta and chicken slices were fairly new. Then there was trouble. The Frankie sausages bundle was EXPIRED, with the skinless sausages manufactured in 12/06/2023 and expired on 11/02/2024. Meanwhile, the cheese sausages were manufactured in 21/06/2023 and expired on 20/02/2024 as circled in the photo.

What if I fried the sausages and gave them to my children without checking the expiry date? Expired sausages are no joke and are more serious than, say, expired biscuits because sausages contain meat which can harbour bacteria such as Salmonella and Botulism. Even worse, the bacterium that causes Botulism has no odour. I cannot believe how such a large company, Keells Food Products PLC, let this happen. Keells is responsible for discarding these expired sausages without selling it to poor customers. Other products, meatballs and French fries, were also nearing expiry.

I informed about expired sausages to Meathouse promptly. They said that they will come on the same day to refund the expired sausages but they did not come or remove the expired sausages listing from their website.

Since it was Easter Holidays, I patiently waited until Monday before calling them again. I called on Monday, but there was no answer from both the direct number and the WhatsApp number. So, I found the number of the marketing department and called them. They just listened and took no action.

On Tuesday, I called again and had to threaten them. Finally, after lot of trying and 4 calls later, they agreed to send out a new pack of sausages on Wednesday and they removed the expired sausages from their website.

Today, after keeping the expired sausages for 6 days in my fridge, I received a refund. Fortunately, Meathouse gave me two brand new Frankie sausages, with the skinless sausages manufactured in 05/03/2024 and the cheese sausages manufactured in 15/02/2024. They even gave a puzzle as a gift for my little one, which I appreciate.

In my opinion, it is better to shop physically in Keells supermarkets instead of buying from Meathouse. This is because Meathouse only offers attractive discounts when products are nearing expiry. In supermarkets, this happens rarely and people can check the expiry dates on the spot before buying."

This evening, we purchased nearly Rs 20,000 worth of groceries, and this very unprofessional cashier started dumping our stuff on the floor.. apparently running out of counter space.

I politely advised her to bag the already scanned  groceries so she would have more counter space to scan the remainder. However, she rudely refused and started to dump more.
My wife then intervened and started to bag our own groceries.

I have no idea why this stupid management tends to pick up such lowest people from the street to save a penny or two and is hoping to achieve the best customer service.

I have faced this situation especially with respect to rebate on Keells cloth bags and price discounted items which are sometimes not reflected on the receipt. Therefore now I request for the receipt then & there.
Yesterday (16.07.2025) morning I had a bad experience at this outlet when it took just less than 5 mins to collect my purchases but took more than 15 mins at the cashier‚Äôs (a trainee without supervision) to get the transaction receipt. The staff could not find anyone to authorize the ‚Äòreceipt‚Äô till I made a fuss about it. Finally, when I got the receipt, I found that the rebate on the Keells bag was not accounted, which proves my accusation.
Keells, please ensure either you reintroduce a compulsory hard copy receipt (just like all other supermarkets) or ensure that a person authorized to issue the receipt is available at the cashiers counters all the time."

I visited Keells Super in Jaffna recently, and I genuinely regret stepping into that place. The staff behavior was shockingly poor ‚Äì no sense of hospitality or professionalism whatsoever. The employees were cold, impolite, and seemed irritated by the mere presence of customers.
From the start, it felt like we were walking into a hostile environment. No greetings, no assistance, and certainly no smiles. When we asked for help, the responses were rude and dismissive, as if they couldn‚Äôt be bothered. It was honestly uncomfortable.
What‚Äôs worse is that the negativity affected even my friend who came along with me ‚Äì we both walked out feeling stressed and disrespected. We expected at least the basic courtesy you‚Äôd get at any decent supermarket, but instead, we were treated with complete indifference and bad attitude.
I‚Äôve shopped at other Keells branches before and never had an issue, so this came as a surprise. This Jaffna branch clearly stands out for all the wrong reasons. The customer service is not just lacking ‚Äì it‚Äôs non-existent.
I sincerely hope Keells management pays attention to this because this branch is a huge letdown compared to the standards we associate with the Keells brand."

I recently visited Keells Super in Jaffna, and I must say it was one of the most disappointing retail experiences I‚Äôve ever had. From the moment I stepped in, it was clear that customer service is not a priority at this branch.
The staff were unfriendly, unapproachable, and lacked even the most basic courtesy. Not a single smile, no warm greetings, and absolutely no effort to make customers feel welcome. Their attitude was cold and indifferent, and the way they speak to customers is shockingly rude and harsh. It almost felt like I was an inconvenience to them rather than a paying customer.
The overall atmosphere of the store was unpleasant and unprofessional. There was zero customer engagement, and even when asking for assistance, the responses were blunt and careless‚Äîas if they were being forced to help. It‚Äôs the complete opposite of what you‚Äôd expect from a store that claims to value customer satisfaction.
To put it simply, this is by far the worst Keells branch I‚Äôve ever been to. I‚Äôve had good experiences with Keells in other locations, so this came as a shock. Jaffna Keells seriously needs a major revamp in staff training and management oversight. The way they treat people is unacceptable, and if this continues, they risk losing more loyal customers.
I hope Keells management takes this feedback seriously because this branch is damaging the reputation of what is otherwise a well-regarded supermarket chain."

Today, at the Keells Supermarket in Kotahena, I had an unpleasant experience at the cash counter. While rushing to transfer items from my cart to the counter table during billing, I accidentally placed one item on the counter hastily. Unfortunately, the staff member at the counter seemed to misinterpret my action as intentional and, in response, threw my butter box. The lid opened, and the butter fell to the ground.

I was quite upset by her behavior, especially since she smiled as if satisfied by her actions. I didn‚Äôt confront her, understanding that the staff may be exhausted from long working hours during this busy time. However, a simple apology from her could have resolved the matter.

I kindly request Keells to ensure that staff members are trained to handle situations like this more professionally and to provide support for their mental well-being."

I will be writing to HQ on this matter because this is a very high health risk, and even the meat and ham displayed looks discoloured and not stored in proper temperature.  Highly disappointed and discussed with this matter. üòï"

The hilarious part is when we pointed out the wrong there the people who were in the counter at the time Miss. Poojani and Harshani acted like we arw wasting their time and we did something wrong. Then Miss.Harshani went to the bakery section and got the correct codes but the pastry she bought back was not what I requested, the boards on the bakery section were also kept wrong as per her. Finally once the billing was done we requested a manual bill and they were making faces when we requested that. Then however they gave a manual bill and it was also wrong. They havent billed the vegetable pastry we bought. We informed that they havent billed it since we did not want to take anything home which we did not pay. Then the drama of the girls began. Miss. Poojani said ""‡∂∏‡∂ß ‡∑É‡∂Ω‡∑ä‡∂Ω‡∑í ‡∂ë‡∂¥‡∑è, ‡∂¥‡∑è‡∂©‡∑î‡∑Ä‡∑ô ‡∑Ä‡∑ê‡∂©‡∂ö‡∑ä ‡∂ö‡∂ª‡∂ú‡∂±‡∑ä‡∂± ‡∂Ø‡∑ô‡∂±‡∑ä‡∂±‡∂ö‡∑ú"" gosh that attitude shook us.

Phones, accessories, random cables, anything tech-related, this is probably where you start. And I agree with that, 100 percent. Most of the online sellers get their stuff from here anyway. There are shops you have to be careful about, but there are also plenty that you can actually trust.

Now, here‚Äôs the issue. Apart from the shops, there‚Äôs really nothing going on. The place is not maintained. No proper cleaning, no effort to make it feel welcoming, and there‚Äôs always some kind of construction happening. Every single time I go there, something‚Äôs being drilled, fixed, painted or half-built. It‚Äôs been going on for years and it never looks like it‚Äôs getting done.

The escalators are a gamble. Sometimes they work, sometimes you‚Äôre climbing them like stairs and pretending that‚Äôs normal. It‚Äôs exhausting. And the place just doesn‚Äôt feel safe. Not saying it isn‚Äôt safe, but the vibe is very off.

The shops themselves are good, but they all look the same. There's no character, no uniqueness, just one glass-fronted tech box after another. It all blends in.

So yeah, pretty disappointing overall. The shops are the only thing carrying the whole place, and even they deserve a better space than this. But I guess this is what we‚Äôve got."

When we buy vegetables, we put them in a bag and hand them over to an employee for weighing. However, I noticed that the employee ties a knot on the bag in a way that alters the weight measurement. As a result, we end up paying not only for the weight of the vegetables but also for the knot and the additional material of the plastic bag.

Later, I decided to purchase two pizzas. Although an offer mentioned that two pizzas were available for Rs. 1,590, I actually bought two pizzas for Rs. 1,690 each, totaling Rs. 3,380. When I was informed that the pizzas were unbaked, the staff assured me there would be no additional charge for baking them. However, when I went to pay, they charged me an extra Rs. 200. I questioned this charge because it felt like they were misleading customers, but they insisted that the additional cost applied and claimed that the person who originally provided the information was unaware of it.

After taking the pizzas home and tasting them, I realized they were nothing more than raw dough with some sauce and a few small pieces of chicken.

But the manager lady is a nice person and she apologized to me regarding not being informed of this earlier by her team. After that she solved my issue and offered the discount at a new bill.

Keells - Kurana is a great supermarket located in Kurana West, Negombo. It has a wide variety of products, including fresh produce, meat, dairy, groceries, and household items. The store is clean and well-organized, and the staff is friendly and helpful.
I recently visited Keells - Kurana and was very impressed with the quality of their products. The produce was fresh and crisp, and the meat was well-marbled and tender. The prices were also reasonable, and I found a number of good deals.
One of the things I really liked about Keells - Kurana is that they have a new EV charging point. This is a great convenience for electric car owners, and it shows that the store is committed to sustainability.
Overall, I had a very positive experience at Keells - Kurana. I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a high-quality supermarket in the Negombo area.
Here are some additional things to note about Keells - Kurana:
* The store is open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
* They offer a variety of delivery and pickup options.
* They have a loyalty program that allows you to earn points and save money on your purchases.
Overall, I would give Keells - Kurana a rating of 4.5 out of 5 stars.

As I was came to the security spot which is next to the door I tried to handover my bag. For that I had to address multiple times to get his attention. Because he was speaking with his friend and took his sweet time coming back to his place to fetch my bag.

And it looked like I was making a huge inconvenience for him to give me a tag for the bag. At least that was the way he was acting.

After doing my shopping I had to carry 6 heavy bags and picked my bag from the security station. He didn‚Äôt even bother to open the door. I had to keep a bag in my mouth to open the door.

I understand his job is not luxury one like a CEO and it must be hectic to stand there, help the customers and gourd the place.
Still when you work in customer service you' d have to learn to be nice to people. At least the customers. Please try to show him how the security officer in Keells Kottawa at Horana road works.

The higher management should be aware of this issue and take steps to improve staff training, ensuring a more polite and welcoming environment.

Additionally, I noticed that when paying by cash, if the balance change is less than **10 rupees**, employees **always ask customers to transfer it to the Nexus loyalty card balance**. While this might seem like a small matter, it is still a questionable practice that should be addressed.

When we buy vegetables, we put them in a bag and hand them over to an employee for weighing. However, I noticed that the employee ties a knot on the bag in a way that alters the weight measurement. As a result, we end up paying not only for the weight of the vegetables but also for the knot and the additional material of the plastic bag.

Later, I decided to purchase two pizzas. Although an offer mentioned that two pizzas were available for Rs. 1,590, I actually bought two pizzas for Rs. 1,690 each, totaling Rs. 3,380. When I was informed that the pizzas were unbaked, the staff assured me there would be no additional charge for baking them. However, when I went to pay, they charged me an extra Rs. 200. I questioned this charge because it felt like they were misleading customers, but they insisted that the additional cost applied and claimed that the person who originally provided the information was unaware of it.

After taking the pizzas home and tasting them, I realized they were nothing more than raw dough with some sauce and a few small pieces of chicken. This experience left me feeling extremely disappointed with Keells. I strongly urge them to treat customers fairly and ensure that no one else has to go through such an experience"

That said, shoppers should be aware that the outlet does not carry fresh turkey, mutton, beef, or pork. The selection of seafood is also somewhat limited. Typically, you'll find options such as sea chicken, prawns, cuttlefish, tuna, koppara, sudaya, thalapath, linna, alagoduwa, and, depending on availability, hendella and crabs.

A convenient feature is the on-site pharmacy, which opens at 9:00 AM. The store also offers a broad selection of liquor, available for purchase from 8:00 AM to 10:00 PM.

One notable drawback is the delayed restocking of vegetables and fish in the morning. For the freshest produce, it‚Äôs best to visit after 9:00 AM ‚Äî though on some days, restocking may continue until 10:00 AM. In the evenings, particularly after 7:00 PM, the selection of vegetables can be quite limited or even unavailable.

The large parking area is a plus, providing ample space for vehicles. However, weighing vegetables can be time-consuming during peak hours, as only one staff member typically handles the task, and occasionally only one scale is operational, leading to long queues."

I visited the Keells Nagawihara branch today and had a very disappointing experience and poor service. I wanted to get some limes weighed and approached the staff member near the weighing scale. Shockingly, although there were no other customers around her, she simply pointed me to another staff member using her fingers without even speaking a word‚Äîno greeting, no explanation, no apology.

When I went to the other girl at the next counter, she was assisting another customer but didn‚Äôt even acknowledge my presence. I waited patiently for nearly 5 minutes, and when she finally reached out to take the limes, she didn‚Äôt say a single word either‚Äînot even a basic ‚Äúplease‚Äù or ‚Äúthank you.‚Äù

I then approached the floor manager, a man with curly dark hair, and politely explained the situation. Unfortunately, he showed zero interest or empathy. There was no apology, no assurance, nothing. His attitude was indifferent and unprofessional very poor service.

This level of poor service at Keells is truly unacceptable. Keells is known for quality and courtesy, but this branch clearly lacks both. If you value being treated with respect as a customer, I would strongly recommend reconsidering your visit to this outlet.

As I was leaving Keells after paying the bill, I remembered that I forgot to buy an A4 sheet of paper. When I got back to Keells and was waiting at the security counter to drop off my stuff, the woman there was watching a video on her phone. She didn't know if a customer was coming. I called her and asked if she had these things, and asked for a token. When I entered, this woman shouted loudly and said, ""This is the second time you have come, it's like I went to Keells to steal. She is following me. People here don't know how to talk to customers. We didn't go to Keells because we had nowhere else to go. There are many supermarkets to buy things, I used to go to Keells every day, so I went to buy things today too. Rajagiriya Keells is a rotten company. That woman talks to people like animals. Please take action against that security woman. I went there at around 12.45 pm.

However, it would be very helpful if you could label the boxes to indicate whether it's vegetable, chicken, or cheese chicken kottu, as it was a bit difficult to identify them at once.
Also, We would appreciate it if the chef could marinate the roasted chicken a little more with spices and salt and roast a bit more. ( inside the colour of the chicken was pinkish.)

I clearly told her tht the shelf did not have any left she asked me to wait, went inside after about 5 minutes, continued with her own course while i was standing there for her response which never came. Without wanting to create a scene i walked away.
2) A guy at the weighing machine was in a deep conversation with his fellow staff and when I went to weigh the fresh goods i purchased and kept near the machine, he simply walked away. Absolute irresponsibility.
3) The fish counter always has slices of stale fish and by the look of it, it is evident. The whole chicken and meat in the fridge too is aging. The reason is that the customers want the meat to be cut and given. When inquired, i was once told the machine is broken and the next by another staff another day that the machine is for cutting fish and not any other meat. Surprisingy last evening I was told by the tall girl at the counter that they do not cut fish.

Being part of JK which I too am a part of from another sector I thought commeting here would better hit the core for a change. Good day."

The supermarket offered a range of features that made the visit convenient and enjoyable.

First and foremost, the availability of ample parking was a huge advantage. Finding parking space can often be a hassle at busy supermarkets, but Keells Wennappuwa had a spacious parking area, which made the entire shopping experience hassle-free.

The quality of produce available at the supermarket was impressive. The aisles were well-stocked with fresh fruits, vegetables, and other groceries, making it easy to find everything on my shopping list. The variety of products catered to different preferences, and the overall freshness of the produce added to the appeal of shopping at Keells.

The friendly staff at Keells Wennappuwa deserves special recognition. From the moment I entered the store, I was greeted with warm smiles and helpful assistance. The staff members were knowledgeable about the products and were more than willing to offer guidance and answer any questions I had. Their excellent customer service played a significant role in enhancing the overall shopping experience.

One aspect that could be improved upon is the layout and organization of the supermarket. While the store was well-maintained, some sections felt slightly cluttered, making it a bit challenging to navigate through the aisles. A more streamlined and organized layout would further enhance the shopping experience for customers.

Despite this minor drawback, my shopping experience at Keells Wennappuwa was undeniably positive. The ample parking, quality produce, and friendly staff all contributed to making my visit a pleasant one. I would highly recommend this supermarket to locals and tourists alike for their grocery needs while in Wennappuwa. With a few minor improvements in the layout, Keells Wennappuwa has the potential to become an even more outstanding shopping destination."

Lack of space comparing to other Keels branches out there which is understandable due to the location. Not clean and appealing than other branches. Customer service is also not the best. It would be better to have more customer orientated staff for better customer experience so you can mitigate the discomforts arisen due to the location.

First I‚Äôll mention the reason for the 3 star rating. The security staff is very friendly and they really maintain a good interaction with customers. The staff except cashiers provides a good service but not good in customer handling. I had a experience once when I was selecting yogurt  from the rack a staff lady came in without saying anything she steps into the rack and restocks some yogurt drinks. So I had to move to another place until she done and leave. No manners at all. When talk about the cashiers, the slowest cashiers I saw in a supermarket. They take more than 10 minutes even to bill a single item. The younger cashiers are as slow as seniors. Expect these staff issues this place recommended for quick shopping visits."
